'''Glyphs in Bokeh are geometric shapes or markers that represent data points on a plot. Bokeh provides a variety of glyphs, such as circles, squares, lines, bars, and more, which you can use to visually encode your data. Glyphs allow you to customize the appearance and style of data points in your Bokeh plots.

To add glyphs to a Bokeh plot, you typically use glyph-specific methods provided by the `figure` object. Here's an example using the `circle` glyph to create a scatter plot:

```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show

# Create a Bokeh figure
plot = figure()

# Define some data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

# Create circles as glyphs
plot.circle(x, y, size=15, color="blue")

# Customize the plot
plot.title.text = "Scatter Plot with Circles"
plot.xaxis.axis_label = "X-axis"
plot.yaxis.axis_label = "Y-axis"

# Show the plot
show(plot)
```

In this example:

- We import the necessary modules, including `figure` and `show`.
- We create a Bokeh figure using `figure()`.
- We define some data points using the `x` and `y` lists.
- We add circles as glyphs to the plot using `plot.circle()`. We specify the `x` and `y` coordinates, set the size of the circles with `size`, and set the color to blue with `color`.
- We customize the plot by adding a title, x-axis label, and y-axis label.
- Finally, we display the plot using `show(plot)`.

This code creates a simple scatter plot with blue circles as glyphs. You can customize the glyphs and their properties (e.g., size, color, transparency) to match your specific data visualization requirements. Bokeh provides various glyph types and customization options to create diverse and interactive plots.'''

'''You can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend, by using various attributes and methods provided by the `figure` object and other Bokeh components. Here's a summary of how you can customize different aspects of a Bokeh plot:

1. **Title and Plot Title**:
   - To set the title of the entire plot, you can use the `title` attribute of the `figure` object:

     ```python
     plot.title.text = "My Bokeh Plot"
     ```

2. **Axes Labels**:
   - To set labels for the x-axis and y-axis, you can use the `axis_label` attributes of the `figure` object:

     ```python
     plot.xaxis.axis_label = "X-axis Label"
     plot.yaxis.axis_label = "Y-axis Label"
     ```

3. **Axis Ticks and Formatting**:
   - You can customize the axis ticks and their formatting. For example, to set the number of ticks, you can use `ticker` objects:

     ```python
     from bokeh.models import NumeralTickFormatter

     plot.xaxis.ticker = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     plot.xaxis.major_label_orientation = "horizontal"  # Adjust the label orientation
     plot.xaxis.formatter = NumeralTickFormatter(format="0.0")  # Format the tick labels
     ```

4. **Legend**:
   - To add a legend to the plot, you can use the `legend` attribute and specify the location:

     ```python
     plot.legend.title = "Legend Title"
     plot.legend.label_text_font_size = "12pt"  # Adjust font size
     plot.legend.location = "top_right"  # Position the legend
     ```

5. **Gridlines and Background**:
   - You can control the visibility of gridlines and customize the background of the plot:

     ```python
     plot.grid.visible = True  # Show gridlines
     plot.background_fill_color = "lightgray"  # Set background color
     ```

6. **Colors and Styles**:
   - You can set various colors and styles for different plot components, such as lines, markers, and fills:

     ```python
     plot.line(x, y, line_color="blue", line_width=2)  # Customize line color and width
     plot.circle(x, y, size=10, fill_color="red", line_color="black")  # Customize circle markers
     plot.vbar(x, top=y, width=0.5, fill_color="green", line_color="black")  # Customize vertical bars
     ```

These are some of the ways you can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot. Bokeh offers extensive customization options, and you can further tailor your plots to meet your specific visualization needs by exploring the Bokeh documentation and available attributes and methods.'''

'''A Bokeh server is a component of the Bokeh library that allows you to create interactive web applications and dashboards with real-time updates. Bokeh server enables you to build dynamic and responsive data visualizations that can respond to user input, streaming data, or other events without requiring a complete page reload.

Key features and concepts of a Bokeh server:

1. **Interactive Plots**: Bokeh server allows you to embed Bokeh plots in a web application and add interactive elements such as widgets, buttons, sliders, and text inputs.

2. **Server Script**: To create a Bokeh server application, you typically write a Python script that defines the layout of your application, the initial state of your plots, and the callbacks that specify how your plots should update in response to events.

3. **Two-Script Model**: Bokeh server applications follow a "two-script" model. One script defines the layout and initial settings, and another script (often referred to as a "curdoc" script) defines the callbacks and updates. The two scripts are run together to create the interactive application.

4. **Bi-directional Communication**: Bokeh server provides bi-directional communication between the client (the web browser) and the server (the Python script). This enables real-time updates as users interact with the application.

5. **Reactivity**: Bokeh server applications can react to a variety of events, including user interactions with widgets, changes in data sources, and timer-based updates. This reactivity allows you to create responsive applications.

6. **Deployment**: Bokeh server applications can be deployed on a web server or cloud platform, making them accessible to users over the internet.

Here's a simplified example of creating an interactive Bokeh server application that updates a plot in real time when a button is clicked:

```python
from bokeh.io import curdoc
from bokeh.layouts import column
from bokeh.models import Button, ColumnDataSource
from bokeh.plotting import figure

# Create a Bokeh figure and data source
source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[1, 2, 3]))
plot = figure(plot_height=300, plot_width=400)
plot.circle(x='x', y='y', source=source)

# Define a callback function to update the data source
def update_data():
    new_data = dict(x=[4, 5, 6], y=[4, 5, 6])
    source.data = new_data

# Create a button and add a callback to update the plot
button = Button(label="Update Plot")
button.on_click(update_data)

# Create a layout with the plot and button
layout = column(button, plot)

# Add the layout to the current document (curdoc)
curdoc().add_root(layout)
```

In this example, we create a simple Bokeh server application that displays a scatter plot and a button. When the button is clicked, the plot's data source is updated, and the plot is redrawn in real time.

To run this Bokeh server application, you would typically use the `bokeh serve` command in your terminal. This command starts the Bokeh server and runs your application, making it accessible through a web browser.

Bokeh server provides a powerful framework for creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations and web applications that can respond to real-time data or user interactions.'''

'''Q5'''
'''To embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using Flask or Django, you can follow these general steps:

**Using Flask:**

1. **Create a Flask Application**:
   - Set up a Flask web application. You can create a new Flask project or use an existing one.

2. **Create a Bokeh Plot**:
   - Create your Bokeh plot within your Flask application. Define the plot and any interactive elements or widgets as needed.

3. **Generate HTML**:
   - Use the `bokeh.embed.components` function to generate the HTML code needed to display the Bokeh plot in your Flask template. This function returns the JavaScript and HTML code required to render the plot.

4. **Create a Flask Route**:
   - Define a Flask route that will render your HTML template. In the route handler, call the `components` function to generate the Bokeh plot's HTML components.

5. **Render the Template**:
   - Render your Flask template, which includes the HTML code for the Bokeh plot. The template should use the `script` and `div` components generated by the `components` function.

6. **Run the Flask Application**:
   - Run your Flask application using the `app.run()` method.

Here's a simplified example using Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
from bokeh.plotting import figure
from bokeh.embed import components

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Create a Bokeh plot
    plot = figure()
    plot.circle([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])

    # Generate Bokeh plot components
    script, div = components(plot)

    # Render the template with the plot components
    return render_template('index.html', script=script, div=div)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

**Using Django:**

1. **Create a Django Project**:
   - Set up a Django project if you haven't already. Create a new Django app or use an existing one.

2. **Create a Bokeh Plot**:
   - Create your Bokeh plot within your Django app, similar to the Flask approach. Define the plot and interactive elements.

3. **Generate HTML**:
   - Use the `bokeh.embed.components` function to generate the HTML code needed to display the Bokeh plot in your Django template.

4. **Create a View**:
   - Define a Django view function that will render your HTML template. In the view function, call the `components` function to generate the Bokeh plot's HTML components.

5. **Create a Template**:
   - Create a Django template that includes the HTML code for the Bokeh plot. Use the `script` and `div` components generated by the `components` function.

6. **Define URL Routing**:
   - Configure URL routing in Django's `urls.py` to map a URL to your view function.

7. **Run the Django Server**:
   - Start the Django development server to run your application.

Here's a simplified example using Django:

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from bokeh.plotting import figure
from bokeh.embed import components

def bokeh_plot(request):
    # Create a Bokeh plot
    plot = figure()
    plot.circle([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])

    # Generate Bokeh plot components
    script, div = components(plot)

    # Render the template with the plot components
    return render(request, 'bokeh_plot.html', {'script': script, 'div': div})
```

In both Flask and Django, you create a web application that includes a Bokeh plot. You use the `components` function to generate the JavaScript and HTML code required to embed the plot into a template. Then, you render the template with the plot components.

Make sure to set up your Flask or Django project with the appropriate directory structure and configuration, and adjust the example code to match your project's needs.'''
